# Machine-Learning

Brief Explanation of the dataset: 
1.	Boston Housing Price Prediction – It is a very famous dataset available in package *_sklearn_* 

2.	In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

3.	It is Regression type of prediction. Since the values are numerical.
